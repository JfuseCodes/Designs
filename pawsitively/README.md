# Pawsitively Web App

Pawsitively is a web application built using React and Chakra UI library that allows users to search for pets available for adoption within their state using the Petfinder API. The app takes a few user inputs, starting with the user's zip code, to determine their location and display available pets in their area. Users can also choose the type of pet they are looking for, and the app will display relevant pets based on their selection.
