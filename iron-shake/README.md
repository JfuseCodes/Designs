## CHALLENGES:
The main challenge I faced was trying to be more organized and methodical. Also, architectural code proved to be a challenge as well.

- Organization: 
  - The way the folder and file structures are set up is very component-based, with every separate file having simple usage for the most part. Since I am just rehashing the fundamentals, instead of React, I used Webpack, and many components were involved.
  - The challenge with organization came from planning the hierarchy correctly and knowing where to place functionality.
  <br>
- Methodical:
  - The methodical challenge, or otherwise the algorithmic challenge, came from the well-known RULE in coding. DRY - DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF. I still feel the code can be better than that simple but important rule.
<br>
- Learning Experience:
  - Although there is so much more for me to learn from Webpack, this project paves the way for someone to understand the usage of a framework like React or other component-based tools. It also gives the developer a much better control and understanding of a project that can keep growing. It will surely benefit someone trying to write maintainable and scalable code.
  
## USEFUL RESOURCES:
Before I jumped into working on the project, there was a few resources I used, but mainly the [tutorial](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) over at the webpack website, to help get the file structure setup.
