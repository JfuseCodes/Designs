## Challenges

- Design/Architecture:
 - HTML hierarchy was essential to provide a smooth transition when styling the web page with SCSS. I went through several challenges in styling, such as deciding whether to use custom positioning, flex, or grid. But ultimately, I was able to solve that problem and went with a combination of all 3.   


## Useful Resources
- To fully understand asynchronous programming in javascript, one must understand callback functions. I used this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNjIUSDnb9k&t=661s) video to get passed that roadblock. Simple and very clear to understand ðŸ”¥
